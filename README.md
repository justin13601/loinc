# Embeddings for LOINC & SNOMED CT Codes and Descriptions

This repository contains descriptions and their corresponding embeddings of SNOMED CT and LOINC ontology codes. The ontology code descriptions were generated using the OpenAI API. More specifically, the descriptions for LOINC codes were generated using the GPT-3.5 model by myself, while the descriptions for SNOMED CT codes were generated by François Remy. The details of the citation for the SNOMED CT descriptions is below.

## Dataset and Model Information

The dataset containing the generated SNOMED CT descriptions can be accessed through the HuggingFace model hub. The link to the Hugging Face dataset is [FremyCompany/AGCT-Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FremyCompany/AGCT-Dataset). Parquet chunk files for both SNOMED CT and LOINC code descriptions, along with their generated embeddings, are in this repository.

## Embeddings Generation

All embeddings for the descriptions and code labels were generated using the ADAv2 model. The ADAv2 model is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI. The generated embeddings capture semantic relationships and meanings in the clinical ontology codes' descriptions and labels.

## MIMIC-IV Annotation Validation Experiment

A set of .

Similarly, the top 100 chart items by occurrence were compiled and manually mapped to SNOMED CT codes.
