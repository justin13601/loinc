# Embeddings for LOINC & SNOMED CT Codes and Descriptions

This repository contains data and embeddings for SNOMED and LOINC ontology codes. The ontology codes and their corresponding descriptions were generated using the OpenAI API key. The descriptions for LOINC codes were generated using the GPT-3.5 model, while the descriptions for SNOMED codes were generated by François Remy. The details of the citation for the SNOMED descriptions are as follows:

**Citation for SNOMED Descriptions:**

## Dataset and Model Information

The dataset containing the generated descriptions and embeddings can be accessed through the Hugging Face model hub. The link to the Hugging Face dataset is [FremyCompany/AGCT-Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FremyCompany/AGCT-Dataset). This dataset includes both SNOMED and LOINC codes, along with their generated descriptions and embeddings.

## Embeddings Generation

All embeddings for the descriptions and code labels were generated using the ADAv2 model. The ADAv2 model is a powerful language model developed by OpenAI. The generated embeddings capture semantic relationships and meanings in the clinical ontology codes' descriptions and labels.
